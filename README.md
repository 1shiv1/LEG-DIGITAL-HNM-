# LEG-DIGITAL-HNM-
A custom CPU architecture made by me, inspired by ARM CPUs, with its primary design feature revolving around the dual operand (which I also call an argument) system. Program instructions are 4 bytes. Byte 1 is the OPCODE, byte s2 and 3 are the arguments for the operation, and byte 4 is the destination address. This system, like many ARM CPUs, also has unique quirks, like how you must add 0 to your value to move values in registers to others, to prevent wasting an OPCODE on 

The register saving pipeline I implemented is a system where saving a value to a register performs on the next clock cycle due to ALU being slower than the clock. The CPU would otherwise have setup time violations, where the register CLK pin is HIGH before any of the data arrives, causing it to write 0 or change nothing. By saving the value and destination in a register for the next tick, it solely has pure control over the saving of register values and DATA and CLK timings, preventing the need for clock skewing or desperately trying to beat the signal to the register. If in the next tick the register that is about to be updated is about to be loaded, the value that was stored is bypassed straight into the requested operand, preventing the use of old data or waiting a clock cycle for the last cycle's data.
